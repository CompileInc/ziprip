- Proper build tools
	- I want to be able to test the browser version against the corpus tests
	- I want to automatically generate in dist/
		- ziprip.browser.version.js
		- ziprip.browser.min.version.js
		- ziprip.version.tgz

- Create a simple example bookmarklet
	- Shows addresses, a few links
	- Mashup with https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding
	- Link to this from the documentation

Future:
	- Add OpenGraph support?
	- Add an inbrowser test set
		- Testling? Honestly, though, every time I've used it it seems massively
		  unfinished, unreliable, and I wish I could have the 6 hours of my life
		  back...
