- Proper user documentation
	- Write documentation so it can be automatically extracted.
	- Make sure the creation of ziprip.js creates it

- Create a simple example bookmarklet
	- Shows addresses, a few links
	- Mashup with https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding
	- Link to this from the documentation

- Create a website for it
	- zipripjs.com
	- https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll

Future:
	- Add OpenGraph support?
	- Add an inbrowser test set
		- Testling? Honestly, though, every time I've used it it seems massively
		  unfinished, unreliable, and I wish I could have the 6 hours of my life
		  back...
