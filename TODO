- Centralize documentation in markdown, rather than some on the website, some in
  the readme.

- Create a simple example bookmarklet
	- Shows addresses, a few links
	- Mashup with https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding
	- Link to this from the documentation

Future:
	- Add OpenGraph support?
	- Add an inbrowser test set
		- Testling? Honestly, though, every time I've used it it seems massively
		  unfinished, unreliable, and I wish I could have the 6 hours of my life
		  back...
