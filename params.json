It also works very hard to try and geocode the addresses it finds, usually by searching the page for things like *Google Maps* elements and so on.\r\n\r\nIt's intended especially to be used for bookmarklets and browser plugins, and used to power a website called [PlaceSteal](http://www.placesteal.com/) that never really took off.\r\n\r\nCurrently it handles UK and US addresses. Adding other English-speaking countries should be trivial, other languages a bit more challenging but certainly doable.\r\n\r\n# Getting It\r\n\r\n## Client-side\r\n\r\nYou can download the latest **browser version** on the [downloads](https://github.com/sheriff/ziprip/downloads) page, or from the `dist` directory.\r\n\r\nFor **node.js**, simply:\r\n\r\n    npm install ziprip\r\n\r\nAnd finally if you just want to play around with it in your **browser's javascript console**, you can do:\r\n\r\n    var script=document.createElement('script');script.type='text/javascript';script.src='http://cloud.github.com/downloads/sheriff/ziprip/ziprip-latest.js';document.head.appendChild(script);\r\n\r\nand then, having given it a second to load:\r\n\r\n    window.ziprip.extract( document, window.URL );\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n*ziprip* has one method you should be interested in: `extract`, which accepts a *DOM object* and a *URL*. For *node.js* you can use [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/) for your DOM object, and in the browser obviously you just pass in `document`.\r\n\r\n**node.js**\r\n\r\n    var $ziprip = require('ziprip');\r\n    var addresses = $ziprip.extract( domObject, url );\r\n\r\n**Browser**\r\n\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"ziprip.js\"></script>\r\n    <script>\r\n        var addresses = window.ziprip.extract( document, window.URL );\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\nThis will return several *address objects*:\r\n\r\nConsider the address: *Prime Minister's Residence, 10 Downing Street, SW1A 2AA, UK*...\r\n\r\n## Attributes\r\n\r\n* `title` - A title for the address: \"Prime Minister's Residence\" in the example above. This may be the same as the first item in `atoms` if we didn't find a more suitable title.\r\natoms - An array of strings, representing the street address. Could be empty. [\"10 Downing Street\"] in the example above.\r\n* `postcode` - The postcode or zipcode for the address. Will always be set. \"SW1A 2AA\" in the example above.\r\n* `country` - The country the address is in. Will always be set. Current possible values are 'US' and 'UK' - \"UK\" in the example above.\r\n* `lat`/`lon` - Coordinates for the address. Some extractors will also be able to determine these, so they're included. Should be either undefined or integer. Undefined in the example above.\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\n\r\n* `isGeocoded` - *Boolean* - are `lat` and `lon` set?\r\n* `flatten` - Returns `atoms`, `postcode`, and `country` as one flat list: [\"10 Downing Street\", \"SW1A 2AA\", \"UK\"]\r\n* `formatForGeocode` - Returns a string suitable for passing to a geocoder. Country is included only if it's not 'US', and other fields are comma-delimited, with title ommitted. \"10 Downing Street, SW1A 2AA, UK\"\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/sheriff/ziprip.png)](http://travis-ci.org/sheriff/ziprip)\r\n\r\n*ziprip* is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/sheriff/ziprip/blob/master/LICENSE.txt/), because all of its external dependencies use it.
